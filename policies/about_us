Our team combines expertise in linguistics, artificial intelligence, and product design to build writing assistance that feels intuitive and human.
CorrectNow uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI to understand context—not just rules. Our technology is designed to enhance human expression, not replace it, while preserving each user’s unique voice and intent.
We are committed to building inclusive, unbiased, and responsible AI that supports diverse communication styles and real-world use cases.

Security and privacy are core to our product
Words are personal. That’s why protecting user data is fundamental to how CorrectNow operates.
We never sell or rent user content. Users fully own what they write. CorrectNow is built with security-first principles, enterprise-grade safeguards, and privacy-by-design architecture.
Our business is powered by subscriptions—not by exploiting user data—so trust remains at the center of everything we build.
