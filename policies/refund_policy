Refund Policy
Thank you for choosing CorrectNow.
This Refund Policy explains how refunds, cancellations, and billing issues are handled for CorrectNow’s products and subscriptions. Please read it carefully before making a purchase.
________________________________________
1. General Policy Overview
CorrectNow offers digital subscription-based services.
As a general rule:
All purchases are final and non-refundable, except where required by applicable law or explicitly stated in this policy.
We encourage users to try CorrectNow Free before upgrading to a paid plan.
________________________________________
2. Free Plan Availability
CorrectNow provides a free version of the Service to allow users to evaluate features before purchasing a paid subscription.
The availability of a free plan is intended to help users make informed decisions and reduce the need for refunds.
________________________________________
3. Subscription Charges & Billing
•	Paid subscriptions are billed in advance
•	Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled
•	Charges apply regardless of usage during the billing period
Once a billing cycle begins, fees for that cycle are non-refundable.
________________________________________
4. Cancellation Policy
You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings.
After cancellation:
•	Your paid features remain active until the end of the current billing period
•	No further charges will be applied
•	The subscription will downgrade to the free plan
Canceling a subscription does not trigger a refund for the current billing period.
________________________________________
5. Refund Eligibility (Limited Exceptions)
Refunds may be considered only in the following situations:
5.1 Duplicate or Erroneous Charges
If you were charged:
•	Multiple times for the same subscription
•	Due to a technical or billing error
We will investigate and issue a correction or refund where appropriate.
________________________________________
5.2 Legal or Regulatory Requirement
If applicable consumer protection laws in your country require a refund, we will comply with those laws.
This may apply in certain jurisdictions for first-time purchases or within mandatory cooling-off periods.
________________________________________
5.3 Service Unavailability
If a paid service is completely unavailable for an extended period due to a verified technical failure on our side, we may offer:
•	A partial refund, or
•	Account credit, at our discretion
________________________________________
6. Non-Refundable Situations
Refunds will not be issued for:
•	Partial use of a subscription period
•	Forgotten cancellations
•	Change of mind after purchase
•	Dissatisfaction with AI suggestions or outputs
•	Lack of usage or perceived value
•	Account termination due to policy violations
AI-generated content may vary in quality and accuracy, and this does not constitute grounds for a refund.

7. Third-Party Purchases
If you purchased CorrectNow through:
•	Apple App Store
•	Google Play Store
•	Any third-party marketplace
Refunds are subject to that platform’s refund policy, and CorrectNow cannot issue refunds directly in those cases.

Any disputes related to payment authorization must be resolved with your payment provider.
